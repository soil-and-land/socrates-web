        <p>The maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for long-term
          productivity.</p>
        <p>Simulation models of SOC dynamics are valuable tools in predicting the impacts of climate on carbon storage
          and developing management strategies for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, however, their utility is
          generally reduced due to need for specific data. </p>
        <p>The SOCRATES model is a simple process based representation of SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, which
          requires minimal data inputs and specifically designed to examine the impact of land use and land use change
          on soil carbon storage. It also contains a simple yield calculator.</p>
        <p>SOCRATES was successful in predicting SOC change at eighteen long-term crop, pasture and forestry trials from
          North America, Europe and Australasia. These trials ranged from 8 to 86 years in duration, over a wide range
          of climates and soil types.</p>

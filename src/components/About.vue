                ecosystems</h4>
              <p>The maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for long-term
                productivity.</p>
              <p>Simulation models of SOC dynamics are valuable tools in predicting the impacts of climate on carbon
                storage
                and developing management strategies for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, however, their
                utility is
                generally reduced due to need for specific data. </p>
              <p>The SOCRATES model is a simple process based representation of SOC dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems,
                which
                requires minimal data inputs and specifically designed to examine the impact of land use and land use
                change
                on soil carbon storage. It also contains a simple yield calculator.</p>
              <p>SOCRATES was successful in predicting SOC change at eighteen long-term non-irrigated crop, pasture and
                forestry trials from
                North America, Europe and Australasia. These trials ranged from 8 to 86 years in duration, over a wide
                range
                of climates and soil types. See <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
